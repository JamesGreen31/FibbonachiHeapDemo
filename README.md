## Overview
A Fibonacci heap is a heap-like datastructure (typically used for priority queses) that has the advantages of performing
most basic operations in constant time.
These operations include
 - Insert
 - Decrease Key
 - Remove

Other operations of a logarithmic time compelxity. These operations include:
 - ExtractMin

The benefits of this data structure really only become apparent with large data sets.

## Classes in this project
There are several data structures needed to make up a fibonacci heap. 
- Double Linked List
- Binary Tree/Priority Queue

For the purposes of this project's documentation, the linked list will be referred to as "The Master Array" and
the elements of that list will be referred to as "sub-trees".

## Project Scope
This project is meant to provide a simple demonstration of the Fibonacci heap. As such, it will work only with integers.
This will be a console only application.
